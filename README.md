# SignBridge - Making Classrooms Accessible for Deaf Students

A comprehensive platform that helps deaf students actively participate in classrooms by making spoken and written content accessible through sign language. SignBridge includes a web platform where teachers upload notes (displayed to students in sign language using a 3D avatar) and a Chrome extension that listens to live classroom speech and translates it into real-time sign language.

## 🖼️ Hero Image Customization

The hero section currently uses a placeholder image from Unsplash. To customize it:

### Option 1: Replace with your own image
1. Place your image in the `public/` folder
2. Update the `src` attribute in `src/components/sections/Hero.jsx`
3. Recommended size: 800x600px or larger
4. Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP

### Option 2: Use a different placeholder
- Update the `src` URL in the Hero component
- Use services like Unsplash, Pexels, or your own CDN

### Option 3: Use the fallback design
- The component includes a fallback gradient background
- Automatically shows if the image fails to load
